            Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It can be used for a wide range of applications, including web development, data analysis, machine learning, automation,
            scripting, and more.

            You can download the latest version of Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system. Once installed, you can run Python code using the
            Python interpreter or use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for a more robust coding experience.

          <p>What is the difference between Python 2 and Python 3 ?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion__answer">
          <p>
            Python 2 and Python 3 are two different major versions of Python. Python 3 was introduced to address some design flaws and inconsistencies in Python 2. The main difference between them is that Python 3 is not backward compatible
            with Python 2. It introduces changes in syntax and library functions. Python 2 reached its end-of-life on January 1, 2020, and developers are encouraged to use Python 3 for all new projects.

        <div class="accordion__question">
          <p>How do I declare variables in Python, and do I need to specify their data types ?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion__answer">
          <p>
            In Python, you can declare variables by assigning values to them directly. Unlike some other programming languages, Python is dynamically typed, which means you don't need to specify the data type explicitly. Python infers the
            data type based on the value assigned to the variable.

      <div class="accordion">
        <div class="accordion__question">
          <p>How can I handle errors or exceptions in Python ?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion__answer">
          <p>
            Python provides a robust mechanism for handling exceptions using the <b>try</b>, <b>except</b>, <b>else</b>, and <b>finally</b> blocks. You can enclose the code that might raise an exception within the <b>try</b> block, and
            handle the specific exception(s) in the <b>except</b> block.

      <div class="accordion">
        <div class="accordion__question">
          <p>What are modules and packages in Python ?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion__answer">
          <p>
            Modules are Python files containing functions, classes, and variables that can be imported and used in other Python files. Packages are directories that contain multiple modules, along with a special file called
            <b>__init__.py</b>. Packages allow you to organize and structure your code better, making it more maintainable and reusable.

      <div class="accordion">
        <div class="accordion__question">
          <p>How do I use external libraries in my Python code ?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion__answer">
          <p>
            Python has a vast ecosystem of external libraries developed by the community to extend its capabilities. To use an external library, you need to install it first using a package manager like <b>pip</b>. Once installed, you can
            import the library in your code and use its functions and classes.

      <div class="accordion">
        <div class="accordion__question">
          <p>How can I write unit tests for my Python code ?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion__answer">
          <p>
            Python provides built-in libraries like <b>unittest</b> and external libraries like <b>pytest</b> for writing unit tests. Unit tests help you verify the correctness of your code by testing individual units (functions, methods,
            or classes) in isolation.

      <div class="accordion">
        <div class="accordion__question">
          <p>What are list comprehensions, and how can they make my code more concise ?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion__answer">
          <p>
            List comprehensions are a concise and Pythonic way to create lists. They allow you to generate a list using a single line of code, often replacing the need for traditional loops. List comprehensions are highly favored for their
            readability and efficiency.

        <div class="accordion__answer">
          <p>Yes, Python is widely used for web development. Popular web frameworks like Django, Flask, and Pyramid provide a robust foundation for building web applications, RESTful APIs, and more.</p>
